# Coursera_Capstone_ Final Report
1) Introduction
The idea of this study is to help people planning to open a new restaurant in New York to chose the right location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same regions.

2) About Data
To provide the stakeholders the necessary information I'll be using New York's census data that contains vital bits of information like Population, household income etc. per Neighborhood and use the Foursquare API to collect competitors in the same neighborhoods.
